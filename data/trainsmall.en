Too interested in yourself to get to know me?
With a divided loyalty,
2 things at once you make mistakes!
Being able to do two things at once is a big part of success.
And it pleases me to think you liked going to bed with me.
I thought I'd have a rich life
Climb as fast as you can.
An idea transcended into life.
Prep for next week's trial.
Fully prepared to have sex for the first time.

Just trying to make a better life for herself.
She was committed to getting out of here, moving on with her life.
Always had concern for the country,
And to devote life to seeking to recover health.
In favor of more.
Just carrying out my duties as a wife as a mother,
She dedicated her life to helping others.
With the single - minded task of doing as much work.
So that I could focus on finding a way
All work and no play?
A pure fighting machine with only a desire to win a war that someone else lost.
And just wants to find Molly millions.
Who are always trying to tear the boy down.
They just give you whatever samples came with the best gifts.
It was easy just to want to save her.
All you want to do is kiss them .
Everything is strictly business. That's a good idea.
Thinking about us.
Who just want to lie down.
I just wanted to get out of there.
With a huge heart who only worries about what he could do for other people.
All she wants is this room.
Because they just want to sleep with a girl
Just wanted to get away from him.
She kept trying to get closer and closer and closer.
When all I wanted was a fresh start.
Someone who has one heart to love only one person
Pretty much everything.
From a womanish attachment to France.
A gent of good intent
Ready and willing to sell them a drug.
Multitasking? Like you wouldn't believe.
Devoted mom.
Seeking power and fortune.
And eager to inflict their fate on others.
Praying for my death.
In hopes that through division
Thinking about singing that song sitting at the piano.
Pet the sweaty.
Married to the mission.
Between training you and getting ready for the fight, it slipped my mind.
Always keeps thinking of Lianzhu

With all intentions of living a peaceful life with his wife and daughters.

A vampire wannabe.
All she wants now is to get home.

He's so hot for me, we give him a whiff of my ass, he'll crawl right in it.
I want to be in the ad game.
Groupies all over you.
Yellow slants who have tried to kill me on many occasions?
Has every intention of our destruction?
The desperate mother who risks everything
You try to take him out with one punch.
Think of how much you want to kill. That's all.
Obsessing about things that don't matter.
I wanted my pills.
All but accused me of murder.
With his heart set on the closest of aye - aye encounters,
Just wanted to get inside your pants.
The vengeful husband and the neglected daughter.
Was knowing at the end of that I would see you.
Women who are obsessed with cleaning their kitchens
Just beIieve in the ball, Jake. And throw yourseIf.
Just waiting to be put out of your misery.
Searching for ways to fill her empty social life.
She was desperate for money.
All we ever dreamed of was having a real family.
Your obsession over making partner,
I only ever wanted to be with him.
Who worked hard trying to bring criminals to justice.
And just wanted to work and make it work,
That would like nothing more than to hijack my master's cargo.
Went bent on... On retribution.
Commodity futures trading Commission wanted to regulate credit default swaps.
Only thinking of making you happy.
Just trying to keep up with him.
Reaching for the moon
About charity and family.
That's what it's like for a struggling actress.
Getting all wrapped up in the asset?
Just making music.
Only our vengeance.
I expect my loving wife to be there.
Looking for some ghetto adventure,
It is a strange thing to wish to die.
So that daddy death wish here could down a bottle of isopropyl.
To believe when Alexander looked you in the eye, you could do anything.
Her willfully thought
Intensive research on his number theories.
Fervently making sure to give each number key a specific forceful push.
With what they were doing in there.
Planning the nationals send off party
I focused on helping other people.
Which could never be determined.
And feeding your family becomes a federal offense.
Attempting to better your social status at school
Pretty much devoted his life to seeing the Sinclairs put away.
What he wanted was a kingdom of himseIf
And the will to take you down.
You're the one who wanted to send her there.
Just make the picture good.
She has her mind set on waiting for the emperor
He wants to run the Federation of crime?
Went around insisting that a witch had turned him into a vampire.
That would keep you in your accustomed places.
Just trying to get to work.
I'm only dancing.
In the pursuit of your career ambitions?
Dying to see you
And dying to see you but it shouldn't be I like this
I sent him to study in England
He's always searching for what's right on the edge
Determined to prevent a radical
One must unite with one
Put up with too much.
I'll call you the instant things let up. Okay.
When the mouth starts going there goes the whole day.
A devoted husband, loving father,
One watch of type Orient.
Move along. Find me.
Show me. Look.
One rag's not enough!
So a terminally ill unsub targets a man who came back from the dead and then starts killing repeatedly.
Come on. Not the dog.
A soap bar and a shirt if you got it.
Quick, this way. All right. Charge!
A moment of weakness, right?
It takes one mistake to change your life.
I could have been in there with them
I could wipe them out with a thought.
Suddenly the skillet was in my hand and I swung.
Your decision, your terms.
And abracadabra energy.
What am I supposed to do? - hold this pen.
What's wrong, Katarina? - nothing.
What was that all about? No sense of humor.
What do you think? - it's nice.
What that bitch say? Each one do what?
Who are gonna dismember me when they find out it's gone.
Kills six more people, and calls back
Outraged Tai lung laid waste to the valley.
And starts cutting people.
We 'll be in trouble,
And in a rage I took my revenge.
If you think,
Thinking sucks.
We rush, we make a mistake
An er nurse. I'm not that into her.
How much in total?
And when you do some of those agents are gonna be alive,
Congratulations. Sir. My God.
Breath.
Would destroy his show - business career in an instant.
We at least are still alive
Breathing your last?
Yet lives?
The last remnants of human civilization.
A walking dead trying to call it an end
Only just. Then there is still time to heal him.
One, your child seems distant, preoccupied.
This whole uptight thing?
From carrying on in your overly exuberant Latina ways.
Away. - right, well, I appreciate it very much.
Something amazing has happened!
Always do. That's what is want to hear.
I've had cramps I miss more. Shoot him on sight.
And when all the ideas start coming just write down.
The thought that.
And the thought of living without each other,
I'm getting shaky thinking about it.
I am so jazzed about this event with the president next week.
I'm just so happy that I don't have herpes.
I just - I always think, like, they're gonna say no cause I've had such bad luck.
To think of not seeing your face every day.
The thought of not being with you.
The thought of not being with you
I shudder at the thought of separating from you!
That there was someone out there like me,
You know as I think about the goodness of Jesus.
The thought of riding in a car makes me want to puke.
At the thought of the paradise
No sooner said than done. Bare - headed as we were.
That Ashley's not coming back,
Thinking about the Atlantis series, l'd like to do more research.
Faced with my own mortality, I might rather be elsewhere.
If I think of anything else, I will be sure to let you know.
Knowing that from now on, you'll do what I say when I say it,
I'm so excited for the party tonight.
I'm really fired up for the show tonight.
The idea that this is the person I'm gonna be from now on.
And the thought of the two of them in bed, and inevitably full of intensity, caused her some conflict.
Consider in what they serve, why the hell do I care?
I can't stand to think of them out there in the shit with out me.
But I can't stand thinking about her like that.
To think he might spend his life alone... Quite, quite.
And the idea that he would grow into a powerful animal or dangerous animal
When I think about whatmight happen to him, I.
The thought of him lying in some ditch.
It makes me sad to think he's gonna be in prison
Considering what he did to you,
My nipples are getting hard just thinking about him.
When I thought about him and it confused me.
It is so on the surface scary when you think about who he is and where he comes from.
I don't want him to go into another rose ceremony
Thinking of his death makes me,
Thinking about him whining all the time bitching and moaning:
I just couldn't bear the thought of a world without him in it.
The thought of him having a life with another woman.
Makes me sick to think we weren't there when he died.
Just the thought of him trying something with her makes me
Knowing everything that he was working so hard to build
I hate to think of him being unhappy.
I get so angry to even think that that guy's alive.
Considering everything that's happened.
It'd be cool to know who else might have died on this cord.
And when I think about losing you,
The thought of losing her
I can't stand to think there wil be some little kid out there
The thought of losing Serena forever.
Thinking about them plastered all over the Internet.
And I've just been feeling like crap thinking that .
And the thought of you two together
The thought of you two living together it's not like that.
The thought of you two living together... It's not like that.
The thought of you two living together.
It makes me so miserable and envious to think you have seen the sea and your poor old aunt has not!
I shudder to think what the redheads get.
And the thought of losing all that money.
The thought of you living here and having our baby here
The thought of your hand back inside me.
The idea of letting you go.
And I got defensive because I thought, what if she's right?
When I imagine you with your wife.
I don't like the idea of you making love with her.
I don't like the idea of you going off island - hopping with her. It's romantic!
If I think of you and the boys.
Lf l think of you and the boys.
The thought of you with my daughter.
The thought of you at home nice and warm, keeps us good.
Ever think that maybe you're lonely
Wanted to kill you for everything you did to me.
And it excites me to death
It pained me to think about your future.
Rejoice at the thought of you
The thought of you... it is gives me hope.
It's so weird thinking that you hated me.
Didn't care if he was caught as long as you were dead.
It's been hard for me thinking you died,
Oh, I shudder to think what you charge
Picturing you looking at the mirror it would scare the shit out of me.
I cannot help but feel that you are madat me.
And to think these little fingers have been.
The thought of you with your big floppy cock
They'll sing to win at nationals
It just makes me sick that your parents are never gonna know that you wrote that story.
To feel your body stuck to mine
I think about what would have happened had you not been there.
I just got really wound up at the thought of you getting checked out by some creep.
I like the thought of you being surrounded by a protection detail.
The thought of you being trapped on that ship,
I can't stand the thought of you getting locked up over me.
Just the idea of you going anywhere with someone
And the thought of you marrying some other guy is.
I was thinking about what you were gonna do to me.
When I thought of you coming all alone,
Thinking of you with someone else just drove me crazy.
You really worry me considering how young you are.
Since it took you this long,
Every time I thought about what you said, I started crying.
If I imagine closing the caravan door, I feel better.
And that it kills me to think about ever.
To think that within a few hours
When l think about it!
The thought of somebody else, you know, holding his hand.
I cannot help but get tense when I think that these will be used in battle.
Oh, I can't get California out of my mind. I know.
The idea that doctors and relatives get to start weighing the quality of a given life
The thought of lunch leaves me numb
It often comforts me to think that even in war's darkest days,
I mean to think that.
I can't concentrate. The thought of my impending incarceration.
The thought of another embassy tea paralyzed me.
The thought of losing you, too.
And it's an absolute tragedy to think of what's happened and how quickly.
It made me happy to think that I'd see you again
The thought of beating you in court is just too hard for me to resist.
The idea of not having you
The thought of never seeing her again， Clark.
Were you getting all misty just thinking of losing me?
Then I suppose he had it, which really steams me.
The thought of spending time with you.
That got to where I am by sleeping with Catherine.
To think I only got two days with the love of my life.
I'm just mad we have to be with those dogs!
And to think your genes will be in our grandchild.
When I think about the way we grew up.
It's nice to think my father might have had something to do
You know I am really scared to go back.
The thought that I'll be here when he gets home helps him through it.
I'm just so excited about the sanctuary.
I can't even think when I'm around her.
Considering how people in this neighborhood feel about me.
Get your mind out of the bedroom.
When you think of garbage, think of akeem.
I can't sleep well knowing he's pulling my strings.
I can't stand the thought of losing my little treasures.
Divas make me want to puke.
The thought of her out here by herself.
Nerve - wracking the idea she might make the wrong choice of husband.
I felt more relaxed
The thought of having them watch me
The thought of her in prison is.
The thought of her with somebody else is making me sick.
The thought of her dating that thievish entitled do well,
And I just would dread the thought that she's a heartbeat away from the presidency.
I can't pretend someone doesn't make my skin crawl.
Just thinking of her I get thirsty.
I thought of her out of there by herself.
To think about her now with someone else,
The idea of her out there, alone.
And thinking how she looked like.
To think of her married to an ordinary gentleman from Kent.
To imagine her humping that pervert makes me sick to my stomach,
To think if you hadn't been there what that terrible man might have done.
Keep thinking if I'd just taken the time to ask a few more questions been more observant me.
The notion that anybody could take me away from them.
My heart grows heavy
When they think of Wisconsin? Come on.
And I think about all the crying and spitting up .
It always makes me sad
I think about it, I get like hives.
What I wouldn't give to see the look on the general's face.
The thought of somebody else,
My heart flutters
I just can't stand to think of that
That makes me so sad.
And that scared me.
It just simply boggles the mind.
Queasy just thinking about it, boss.
I'm feeling nauseous from memories of wedgies and swirlies!
I get quite excited by the prospect of the annual bring and buy sale.
This whole idea of a young woman
I cannot think of Frank Churchill
Thinking of flint, it were has done me.
Even the coffee smells better knowing
Just think of all the rich people out there with cancer and tumors.
It is amazing to think that
And the idea that you sitting up there in that chair,
It's strange to think I used to be one of those girls
The thought that we're in the same room
I hated the thought of our last family meal
The thought of losing her.
I'm excited about doing it ourselves.
Knowing what we did.
And to think that after everything we went through,
The thought of us
Thought we left Miami
The very thought of our repatriation is.
It agitates me to pain that the skyline over there is ever our limit.
The thought of us possibly meeting,
To imagine that I would feel the pain
I can't even begin to explain to you how much I am gonna miss you.
I can't even begin to explain to you how much I'm gonna miss you.
It's kinda weird to think
I think of getting her
It drove me crazy to think my son would grow up a stranger.
The idea of me naked
To think that he might have been killed here my poor brother.
And the idea that I could have
It's hard to work up an appetite, wondering whether or not I have a job.
Anything I can imagine finding in there I'm scared of.
Yeah, just the thought of my daughter out there in this movie,
Hate to think I put a target on her.
When I seen what I did to that kid down at the store.
You know I'm getting shaky thinking about it.
Cause that image makes me hungry.
And to think that l fucked that up
When I think about how we came to America!
What hurts is knowing how badly I treated that poor girl.
And to think I'd taken the house keys!
Just thinking about how much you owe me for saving your life.
Which is kind of daunting because I sleep in the nude.
The thought of my fiance's touch sickens me
When I think that I might have prevented it!
It's hard to have a good time knowing my parents might be worried.
It's horrible to think how much of my life
It would be nice to think me son were happy then.
To think you couId come to a pIace Iike this.
To think that my wife whom I trusted and proud of,
When I think of my child brought up like that.
I'm totally freaked that the teeniest procedure I perform, I'm gonna kill someone.
And the thought of my life with out you.
And the thought that my legacy has come to this
Thinking that I really lost you made me regret every horrible thing I've ever said to you.
The whole idea of sleeping in a dead girl's room
I can't Iive knowing all the pain I've caused everyone.
And to think that I could make something that could.
Just imagining my life as a member
It's just scary thinking that I might see him again.
The thought of bringing you back to that hellhole, to a place where you could get killed
The thought that my semen mixed with bin laden's.
I think I pitched myself off the astronomy tab
And the idea of another 10 years of it
When I think of the scenarios I could have thought up, I'd kick myself.
Just can't stand to think of all those patients
You got a beef come meet with the chief.
To dispense with any thought of a Regency.
The mere idea of seeing you for the holidays
In one second I'm thinking life sentence,
Funny to think one will be in the thick of it tomorrow.
and I can't help laughing myself at your surprise
And to think that that little girl has grown into the one woman
I'm just happy when I think of Thursdays when you come see me.
The thought of a child without legitimacy in the palace of Naples.
I mean the idea of something bigger than me, a God,
The thought about anybody seeing those tapes,
When I think of peopIe going hungry it breaks my heart.
Feel a bit funny about it, you know, since.
I'm sick of everything always being about you.
I'm scared that it's hereditary.
The fact that everybody can hear me puking.
And I was thinking about how when I see you or I hear your voice on the phone.
I can't stand to think about eternity,
I can't bear the thought of it going to a homeless person.
When I think of warmth then I'll think of you
It's scary to think that your life can end
It's amazing when you start thinking about babies.
The thought of Gaius' hands upon me.
Thinking about seeing him.
How thrilling it must be to go bankrupt.
It's sad to have the thought of leaving.
Words fail me when I contemplate the bald eagle.
Just the idea of standing around that hospital room watching you die,
Just the thought of somebody doing that to Alison is really
Considering the first record
To behold Solonius's face when he sees me
I just feel safer knowing he's around.
What comfortable word is wholly yet
It's almost as though the thought of marriage
I nearly gave the tapes back,
The thought of marriage turns my stomach.
I feel, if I can fly free of it, that pleases me.
The thought of walking free from this
The idea that we had been
If I thought I was going to end up like miss Bates,
Thought they were gonna lose!
Tonight I write the saddest lines.
And to have the idea that you're going to go out,
It upsets me a little bit to think that art should be allowed to make statements.
The idea that Irene was murdered by a shadowy kingpin
Thinking of Emily, I often wondered about my own mother
It chills me to think what Morgause has planned for Arthur.
Son of a wealthy man who nearly passes out at the thought of blood,
The idea of being touched
As long as it's on the cuff and not on my back.
Scares me to death to be put to sleep.
There's something nice about the thought of being rocked to sleep in water.
The thought of losing two daughters at once,
The idea of just getting up there, I get all pale and sweaty.
The thought of having to bury your own son.
The whole idea of paying for a ride
The thought of hurting you fills me with profound sorrow.
I'm a heartbeat away from becoming first wife
You get queasy when it comes time to finish, is that it?
And then it nearly killed me to add in all those grammatical errors.
Still gags at the thought of kissing her, then be my guest,
It makes me laugh imagining kissing you.
I am repulsed by the idea of making the sex with a woman.
The thought of going back to that house.
I can't stand the thought of raising a child on that ship.
The idea of losing him, too.
Tore him up thinking she was gonna raise their little girl.
The thought of being a father.
The thought of popping one of your beets into my mouth
The thought of staying at a hotel near the runway unnerved me.
And think of what you have to endure.
I hate to think OS you and your wise up here alone,
And the thought of her being thrown
And the thought of giving him that last part of me.
The truth was the thought of holding him terrified her,
The thought of clasping your greasy hands
The idea of just getting up there.
For real forever, and I'm just.
Just the thought of sticking
As I thought about Ieaving the apartment that I had Iived in for the past decade.
And I just hate the thought
The thought of leaving you breaks my heart
I get a bad feeling everytime when going to meet ‘that person'.
The idea of a bank being the guardian... Stop this nonsense, Jim.
It's tough to get used to the idea of retiring.
The thought of sending him away to fight.
The idea of reliving her death.
The idea of facing an empty apartment
Who stands to win from all of this?
I'm real excited, I love doing runway,
You hate having to wait and come back and try again.
Kind of sad when you think about it.
And in that thought, all my guilt flies away.
I think of the horror that has been inflicted on this 15 year old girl,
That's quite an incredible tradition when you come?
I really resent it!
I get horny just thinking about it.
Shiver just to think of it.
I'm all chicken skin just think about it.
Though it does kill me to imagine
So, with that and the open bar in mind,
The thought of what ingredients might constitute this filth repulses me.
This thing goes to a man's head.
To think it almost happened to me really bothers me.
I get white knuckles thinking about what might be ahead for those folks.
The thought of all that weed down there in the sewer,
It's unbearable for me to even contemplate.
The very thought makes me tremble.
I get goose pimples just thinking about it.
It pisses me off when I think of that asshole.
I'm tired of letting this thing play with my head.
To think after all these months you were here by yourself it just breaks my heart.
The thought of what ingredients
Uh, you know it's funny to me when I think about it.
Just to think that this is the last day.
It's crazy to think that you know
The heart constricts at the thought.
I'm swelling up just thinking about it.
I get sad just thinking of it.
Think of it as a glorified sparring session. Here's something you'll like.
I'm mortified that this outrage happened on U.S.
I tremble just thinking about this trip.
You know that's when it hits you, that.
To think that I might suddenly.
The more I think about this the more it concerns me.
The very thought of discovery.
The thought of that fucking Syrian
The thought of that monster crushing her.
And when I think of that delightful old gentleman.
I shudder just thinking about it.
And with that mental picture,
The thought of that fucking Syrian shoving his devious cock inside her.
It's astounding to think that this horror happens
It's scary to think so much is out of one's control.
I find it distasteful to even contemplate the horror facing all those on board.
Oh, my heart starts pounding just thinking about it.
Think of all those unfortunate souls living in the hell of the trenches,
The thought of that whole part of our life driving away.
It's just all the details are stressing me out.
The idea of famous Hollywood people wearing a button -
That's the part I can't stand.
I still shiver when I think back on those cold winter nights.
Knowing that phantom was living my life with Lana for over a month
It fucking kills me to think he's being punished for the shit I done.
Uhh the thought churns the stomach.
It pisses me off that any guy can touch this beautiful thing.
I can't face the thought of food.
Just thinking about her makes my toes tingle.
Thought it was you.
If you think you're dead.
You figure out pretty quickly where the other kids go.
So you knew we were gonna go somewhere into combat.
Imagine the gossip if he saw you.
Would you like some more whiskey? - yes, please.
The thought of it just killing me.
It makes me cringe to think people would be walking on eggshells, treating me all nice.
When I think of his parents, I'm a bit scared
When I remembered you I went to the mansion.
My tits are aching for you.
The thought of going back to that house.
I'm mad just thinking.
Just thinking about her gives me a hard - on, like now.
The hideousness of that foot will haunt my dreams forever.
When we remember Qu yuan
It breaks my heart to think
It breaks my heart to think of our hopeless love.
Thinking about our first kiss stiII makes my heart flutter.
I can't eat it thinking of my family
And to think my little girl.
It just makes me see red all over again.
I can barely keep my legs together at the mere thought of it.
I get hard just thinking about it.
And it kind of makes the food come up in my gullet.
I was peeved just thinking about it.
I'm still completely mind - boled by the fact that
I think about it and start crying.
To think of the years I spent in the gulag,
You guys excited about going to London?
And whenever she wondered, there was a story she always remembered,
I am very excited about this date. We're going to Hunan balcony.
I live in torture thinking of these moments.
And the thought of that girl.
Brings a tear to my eye when I think of that little guy.
And acting unilaterally.
For your family that they'll leave you?
For your family that they'll leave you? Because they will.
Hell - bent on doing nothing that might challenge their audience.
I have a cold. You look pretty sick.
Sensing danger, the mother rat races home.
How do you feel? - fine, thanks.
When you panic you make mistakes.
So take it easy. wait.
Two quick equals one slow.
Episodes season 02 episode 03
The same forever.
A rut? You just started dating.
Following instructions? Where's the creativity in that?
Miss rigid.
Rigid!
There's nothing wrong with being predictable.
Our rut? We just started dating.
I get bored when I stay still.
It's the way people try not
Consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, Watson.
The forever cheese.
The way it's always gonna be.
The same conversation, every time.
Always the protector.
Stay all your life, do the same thing?
I go where life takes me but some days it makes me
Naturally with a fixed salary,
And long - distance love affairs that never go anywhere
The same old bread and rolls to sell
Always the same. Fish or souffl? Day after day.
Ten percent. fifty percent.
Fifteen, Jabba. Don't push it.
15, for my children's sake. You don't have any children.
Like ten percent?
He is an adult male.
Ten percent is completely out of the question.
Ten per cent of whatever I recover.
I'm 42, but it doesn't show. - I'm 35.
Me? - did you have other men?
I'm not gonna get hurt. I'm not gonna back off.
I'm not telling. - someone I know?
I'm not particularly nervous. - all the better.
I don't feel the same way as Johan. - how do you feel?
I won't do thing to harm her. Oh, come, come, hogbrain.
First, I am not a coolie.
That wasn't what I meant. - then what did you mean?
One. I don't know!
I don't know the code.
I don't have it, please.
I don't know how to get over this. - Oh, darling.
I cannot let you pass. But you said Ludo is your brother.

Lose, and be losers.
And when it couldn't have him, it turned its gaze to the other child.
You slip up, there's nothing there to save you. You're done.

Once Igoe is inside and takes command of their pod.

I don't know once the bit's between her teeth.
Once she snaps out of it,
And once she's gone.
So when she's not around or gets busy,
And once she's eliminated as a person of interest.
She's not like that once she gets to know you.
Once she understood the mood I was going for,
There is nothing to say she won't become a good mother to them
As soon as she's out of the vehicle, she becomes that much more vulnerable.
And they'd come into your beautiful home,
The moment you give them their power back,
Once they start drinking, we all do.
Once these girls start erasing.
And when they start to wake up,
When they're in agreement,
As soon as they realize that you'll love them no matter what they do,
Once they get their claws in, you're hooked for life.
But once they see the flowers and the food,
Once they've crossed, there is one less trafficking victim in Bosnia.
Once they're in the kitchen, isn't nothing left to do but give them a key to your house.
By the time I get my hands on the lost souls,
I'm probably going to miss feeling that once the girls are gone.
So right as they woke up,
Once she does, the program converts the details
As soon as she buys you out, she kicks you out.
Whatever she decides, she can do.
Once she decided she wanted to do something, there was no stopping her.
Once she walks out, we can pick her up.
Once she shows up, you'll meet her and give her the money.
Once she reaches the triangle, we stop no exceptions.
Once she testifies, you're gonna spend
As soon as she finds that out,
As soon as she finds that out, things are never
As soon as she finds that out, things are never gonna be the same.
If she figures out what you've been doing
Once she finds out about you, she'll be drinking again.
The minute that she finds out how you got this information,
If she finds out what the Russians have done,
And once she sees I'm the good guy,
And the second she finds out about it,
If she goes public with that story,
All she need to hear was the sound of your voice.
And then when she was finished or the bad things were over
Once she does.
No sooner does she tell you who you are,
And once she kisses you,
If she hooks up with the Russians, there will be no way for me to save the program.
Once she and her sister run out of thesickle cell meds we gave them,
Once she does, will the property be mine again?
And the benefits run out in November when she turns 18.
Whenever she stays out there too long
As soon as she gets a little stronger,
Once she learns the ropes, takes us legit.
You'd be surprised how those small ones
Once she'd stay put,
Once she finds a place we are all going.
And once she does, I don't think she'll be getting too serious about him.
But once she does.
Once you've had a blowjob, you'd understand.
I leave when I know she's okay.
Once she makes her offer, you sweep in and make your arrest.
And the moment she starts hinting around for a commitment,
She starts poking around her mother's murder, they'll come after her again.
Once she started taking on the attributes of wonder woman,
Once she's got what she came for, she'll piss off again.
And when she gets what she wants, she'll get rid of you.
As soon as she regains her strength, I will leave with her.
Ah, soon as she's fit,
And once she's stabilized we'll take her to the I C U.,
I'm sure he'll tell us as soon as she's stable enough to return to surgery.
And once she tries to leave Storybrooke, well.
And once she gets an idea in her head.
Once she remembers who we were to each other the life we had together.
Once she became aware of the connection between them,
As soon as she realizes what a pain in the ass a baby is,
As soon as she feels it is safe
Once she becomes a geisha, she 'II need many a eimono.
Because the minute she became a liability, you got rid of her
Not since she put that ring on her finger and said "yes".
One call to the cops and you're looking at 25 to life.
And once that happens, we subpoena you,
They'll be ready to extract her
The minute she takes her hand off that car,
If she went to the police, you would need a cover story
And when she does, you will cease to be useful.
Look, once she gets that warrant, I can't stop her,
Except once she had her money,
As soon as she gets the crystal back,
Once she's retrieved the module .
Once she takes that life back!
And as soon as she accepts her new role, her fate is sealed.
And when she's close, I grab her.
And if she starts behaving differently.
She's still gonna kill herself
After she understood the mood I was going for, it was better, much better.
Soon as she figures out that I'm not her new toy, we'll be fine.
She trade me in the second she got something better
Once she had evidence against the fund,
And if she makes the slightest move, then we right!
Once she'd killed her baby, she took off herself.
Once she's here,
And if it comes in contact with this， Yes, it blows up.
Once she feasts her eyes on Texas, it's all over.

Once she's dead and you're on wife number two,
And once she was dead, why stick around?
As soon as she dies, I'm gonna become a civil engineer.
Once she snaps out of it, where does that leave us?
If her father ever found out,
As soon as her father lets her down,
Would all this go away once she delivered?
Once she's in, she will send a message to earth.
But once her lawyer seizes your baseball card collection,
Once her heart stopped beating,
Once her heart stopped beating, there should have been hardly any blood flow
One she'll miss once the novelty wears off,
I 'll probably find out more once I get her diary translated.
When she gets you in her sights
As soon as you can get her blood pressure under control?
That they get caught up in
But once there's one in her sights, that's pretty much it.
And I think once she gets a look at these.
Once she gets to the underpants, they're a deal breaker.
If she sees the police, she'll set it off.
Love will kick you up the arse as soon as look at you.
Once she sees you, she's gonna realize that you tricked her,
She sees you, it's over.
Once she's got them,
And when she sees it's you calling,
Who, at the sight of her will recover much, much faster, won't she?
But once she sees dead Americans
And if she did know you, I think she'd really like you.
Then she's gonna come home all weepy and you'll be tell in her.
Inform me as soon as she touches ground!
Once she sees who you are
Once she sees who you are

Once she's stable, we will do this properly.
Once she's on the stand we start to lift the veil
Once she signs the papers... I know.

Once I get her to trust me, I might need you to talk to her.
Once, she was able to love.
Once she's out of danger,
Once she figures out she hates us.
And once it is given.
Once she's in the system, she'll never get out again.
She almost certainly will when she returns to her village,
At a time when marrying the prince of France or the king of Spain.
You can't delay laboronce it starts.
Once she asks me not to throw this wedding,
If she ever remembers me, her mind will burn and she will die.
Because if she wins, she's gonna own me. My advice?
When she passes away, you're on your own.
As soon as she's 50 yards outside of the complex and
Once she turns that corner, she steps off the grid.

It's all about saving lives. It's got to be done.
This was all about a cover up?
It's all about creating equity.
To save his life.
And it's all to set you free.
All for trying to save people's lives.
This is about what's best for the magazine.
Survival's what it's all about.
And it's all to be near Esmerelda.
It's all about winning.
All in the hope that Mrs. Nitta adopts pumpkin instead of you.
All in the hope that Mrs. Nitta adopts pumpkin instead of you
In order to bring out your love for each other.
They only shouted so as to enjoy the beer all the more.
It's all about respect bro.
All for love of Danae. No!
Is that what this is about?
That's what this is about.
Everything led me to this moment.
It has everything to do with that boy.
This is all about the money, my man.
This is all for you.
It's all for us.
Everything's about the tests.
It's not true that everything is learned.
Everything was just screwing, screwing, screwing, and then cut to a money shot.
Everything was planned ahead?
The whole thing is a setup.
Everything was scripted down to the minute
It's all about human choices.
Everything's what?
It all started when he was in a concentration camp.
It began with the feeding.
It all started with cheese.
Everything's been going on since I was 12.
It all started when we caught wind of an obit.
It all began back when I was 17.
It all started when my mom went to work at Max's video store.
Everything starts with a story book.
Everything starts as "just friends"， but the next thing you know.
It started with a chair.
It all started here at take off.
Started off in the navy.
So it all starts in the cell. The cell is a protein - producing machine.
It started when Ashley got involved
It all started with a lie.
And say here, this place is where it all began.
It all began right here， a hundred years ago.
I planned all this from the word go.
Well. It all began right here. On this spot.
And everything started from then
That's where this all got started.
And they're the ones that framed you.
He did this.
This is all just to get to him.
All of it is his idea.
Everything was his idea.
It is his. He owns it!
Everything is his doing.
It's all in his imagination?
He planned the whole thing.
He planned it.
He's plotted everything.
It's up to him, isn't it?
And he did it with malice and premeditation.
You planned this whole thing.
You did everything.
It's always about you.
It's all about you, it's always about you!
You did say yes to everything, and unfortunately,
There was only manipulation.
That you were on top of everything,
You set all this up just so you could get me in bed.
You're behind this!
You brought this on them
You caused this. Your play, your words.
And you're just making all of this up,
It's all your fault
You taught her everything.
And all.You know?
You're misrepresenting everything.
You are making this up. No, I'm not.
Everything is for you.
Everything's your.
You're running the show, aren't you?
It's all your blessings, whether smiles or tears.
It's all up to you.
Whatever happens to them is all on you.
Everything is your choice.
Everything's your fault.
It's all your fault, motherfucker.
This is all your fault. You chased her away!
You happened, Grayson.
Everything is a conspiracy theory with you! Quiet! I can't think!
Everything is the way you left it. I haven't touched a thing.
You did all this
You were behind this?
All this is you. It's you, Jack.
Like you make up everything.
You just made that up. Yes, I did.
That you made it all up. That's fucking great.
You brought this on yourself.
You did this to yourself, Michael.
You did this to yourself.
You'll have to explain to your kid.
Did you make this whole goddamn thing up?
It's your plan. All I did was get you the man.
You had all this planned already.
The decisions were yours.
You put us through all this?
It was all just pretend.
It's gonna be worth it.
When I am his queen and give him a son.
It was all fake.
None of this was real?
Nothing's real
There's nothing real about it. They're programmed.
It's all a fraud! A lie!
Everything is an illusion.
It's all fake
It's a sham fuelled only by the memory of former glories.
Everything is image.
Everything is image, image is everything
I was carried there by the current.
Everything was on the house.
It's all so new and you're adjusting to so much
It's new and it's modern and it's American.
It's all very professional.
All others are fair game.
All's fair. Right?
Well, in all fairness, you had a running start.
It was all on the square.
Everything is about power for you.
Everything is about your career, your job, your hair.
It's about finding people.
It's about the souls.
It's about what a man will do for love.
It's all about lines.
It's all about this.
It's like everything.
Everything is someone else's fault.
It was written.
The universe has been conspiring,
Well, it was allquite impulsive, really.
It starts with a seed of anger.
Totally anonymous.
And all sold to the highest bidder he.
Everything is part of the atomization because it's been taken over by the Nazis.
How it used to be.
It's the same old story. The rich get richer,
Nothing that hasn't been blessed. Nothing too spicy.
That it was all a lie.
Everything is excusable.
One at a time each variable must be solved.
Everything is quantifiable.
Everything is possible，is done in the name of love and solicitude.
Is nothing done but legal.
That's the drugs talking.
Destiny is just destiny.
Somehow we're meant to be together
This is what's in store for me. - you know that's not true.
All are architects of fate
It's always about you.
This is all because of you, Napplebee.
This is about you and me sleeping together.
This is all because of you. Because of me?
All because you couldn't come out from under the covers.
All because of your foolishness
Because of your expert opinion.
This is all about your ego.
And everything to do with your genetics.
And all because of her.
That's what did it.
And that's all because of me.
All because I slept with her five years ago.
Everything changed for all of us.
All this is because of me. I'm sorry.
It's all my mom's for leaving us.
All because my best friend couldn't stand me being so happy.
All this started because my friend Maurice came by my house.
I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job.
It's all about color.
That's what this is about? A drug?
That's all due to this trauma.
You're what all this is about, aren't you? What are you?
I brought it on myself.
It just jacked everything up.
That's all there is to it! You've betrayed me!
That's how this all started, isn't it?
This started because of a gig in this shithole.
That universe is revolving around us,
Anything the king or his lawyers decide it to be.
That it was a set up. That I'm totally innocent.
And he has a plan for us after all.
It all started when I first heard the rumors and whispers "around campus about a secret society who called themselves" king and shadows.
Everything went as you planned.
It's where it all begins.
Everything's a movie.
Everything is role - play， Remember?
Everything was handled over the phone.
This is where it all happened.
This is where it happens.
And everything's already broken. I spend my weekends fixing things.
Up until that point was trash?
Everything's physical. Yes. We are physical beings.
Everything is complicated, badly developed and poorly written.
All which are brain activity.
It's all just a choice.
That's up to the man in the sky. I'm talking to her.
It becomes frustration, you know it is devastation.
She's making Anna do all this
Yeah. She lied about the whole thing.
She taught me everything I know.
It was her idea.
Everything is her fault!
Everything's good. It's good. He's good.
Everything is good guys this bad guys that.
Everything just was so hard.
Life was going flow in usual layout.
All the old familiar places.
Everything is so twirly.
Everything was beautiful.
Things'll be great when you 're...
Everything is as it must be at this moment.
Everything is part of the buffet of the universe.
Everything's set.
It's all arranged, isn't it?
Everything is perfect.
For when the baby came. That's all.
It was all very logical.
Everything looks good to me.
Look, take it up with the joker. He killed your woman.
Everything belongs to the group. But we're hungry.
Everything is new and it's clean.
Everything for your career, no time for anything else,
Like this job was forced on you. Nate, I get it, okay?
Everything was gigantic.
All this is in your head.
Fact isn't what you see
All of it is overwhelmingly beautiful.
Everything went in that direction. I know.
All good from where I'm sitting.
All in vain
There's nothing anyone can do.
How would anything begin?
How did it all begin?
We're all related.
It's all connected, isn't it?
It's all your boons， whether smiles or tears
What happened was an accident!
It was an accident. Okay.
It's all a trick. It's an illusion.
It was Ashur!
It's everything I ever wanted.
I'm sorry for everything it's my fault.
Sorry for everything. Okay.
You know it was aII my fault.
You know it was all my fault
Instead, we did everything.
Are we responsible for this, or the ones who caused us to come here?
I did them all!
I did all that, so what are you going to do?
I did that. I hooked you up with everybody.
My mother just decideseverything, you know?
I arranged everything.
All of this is because of me.
L caused all this, right?
And this is what I saw.
All on my own.
I owe you everything.
Everything in mine.
All of it, Kevin!
All of this it's my fault.
It was all my fault
That I'm making all of this up?
It's all my fault. - what's your fault?
Everything was my fault. Well...
It was a stupid mistake. When I lost my son,
I'm sorry about everything. I just want to talk
What happened in new York was all my fault. I didn't read the signs.
It's all mine. Until the end of days.
Everything was my idea.
I made the whole thing up.
No, I did that all by myself.
That I forced myungsin to do everything.
I got to be the boss.
I made this mess, now I'm gonna clean it up.
I forced you to do all that. No. You did not.
If not for rent.
Everything is exactly the way it was meant to be.
Everything went according to plan,
That's the way she's gonna be treated.
That everything is free will
Everything's gotta be a fucking challenge for you.
Everything's been a setup coming from way up top.
It was all politics, to get back at me.
All are politics, all
It's all politics. I think you'll understand.
Everything was open and now,
All things are a number.
It's all in the math.
Everything is a definite number,
It's all new.
We didn't purposefully start this.
Everything was determined by Japanese army.
It's about moments, man. That's all that.
Everything was temporary.
The best of everything.
Things worked out all right in the end.
We're all bound by a legal statute.
They're alive.
There was everything under the sun.
We're in the master, babe.
Everything's risk.
It's all my fault
Everything else is who knows?
Everything was up in the air.
Everything's just unknown, so it's really hard to deal with,
Everything is as it is,
And everything's the way it should be,
Everything's mechanized and standardized.
Everything is copasetic.
Everything seems hazy I'm a wild one
Everything works fine.
It's all decent business.
Normally distributed, but an implication
Everything's a weapon. Everybody's an enemy.
Something was falling into place.
There's no there, you know?
And all are Bolingbroke's.
I'm where I'm supposed to be. I was wrong，You're the right guy.
Everything happened as it should.
Everything is a test.
It's all a game.
And it all comes out of mine.
All is gray!
I'm following Clark's orders.
That everything's separate.
Everything's a joke and everything's a test.
It's all here and now.
Everything was status quo.
It's all business.
It's always business, especially where the Hardwicks are concerned.
It's all business, that's what you failed to grasp.
Everything's stuck on using iron.
That you were the first ones.
When it comes,
It starts and ends with the Union. Understand? I came to you, right?
Everything is made of energy.
It's all in the eye of the beholder.
Everything just runs directly off the blood.
Everything is right out in the open.
In one another's being mingle why not I with thine?
Everything is connected.
So everything is its mirror image.
It's all relative.
This is as real as it gets.
It's all real and you know
It's all real and you know?
It was real and it was great, and it was really great.
Everything's true.
This is really happening, isn't it? She's leaving.
Everything's real, darling.
It's all real. The beast is here.
All of it was real? My mom's gone?
It's all happening for real, Trent.
It's all just guesswork.
All is fleeting, all will go; What is gone will then be pleasant.
Everything was temporary
Everything is a secret.
All else is vanity.
Everything's a joke. Everyone's a punch line.
It was all lies, wasn't it?
And the picture on my desk of my family is a phony,
Everything's calculated.
Everything would be a Roman church.
I didn't believe in fairy tales,
They all happen because God wills it.
Everything's in its place.
Nothing has changed, that's the problem.
Everything's a test, remember? Nothing is what it seems.
It's all a matter of listening of being ready to take it down
That is a mathematical certainty.
It's all gone to shit. What do you mean?
Is just to be a little spontaneous.
It will happen all by itself as you get older.
Everything happens inside the city itself.
Ferguson organized everything.
I stand as weak.
It's all pretence.
It's all make - believe.
It was all a pretense, an excuse to get you on your own.
Nothing really happened. Yeah.
No, this isn't real.
All was nothingness
And all for nothing.
Nothing's what it seems
Everything would look beautiful on the outside,
Everything is permitted.
It was all an act.
All to convince us that we'd better make a deal.
It's all about the catwalk.
It's all a setup.
It was carefully planned.
It was all a big mistake.
Everything's about how wonderful the family is, with lots of exclamation points.
A recipe for murder.
And it's all a lie.
Everything a lie.
Everything is a lie?
Everything's a lie!
Was everything just a lie?
It's all been a lie, hasn't it?
It was all a lie, huh?
There is no truth! This is
It was all a lie， even his name?
That it's a fallacy.
Everything's built on that! That's all we got, boy. Fucking all.
I'm putting it all behind me, you know?
Just rolls right off your back, doesn't it?
He masterminded everything.
The best that this youngish man's money can buy.
Everything was just so elegant
Everything was perfect just like I always dream it would be.
That's what brung it down on us.
It's all so beautiful.
Everything was just so.
That's how it all starts!
That's how this all started, right?
Everything fits perfectly. They type you are.
Everything was taken care of through an intermediary.
It's all done via computer.
Everything goes through a third party.
Whole thing was arranged online - e-mails. I got 50 grand wired into my account.
It's been amazing.
Everything is so freaking.
Everything matching.
It seemed hopeless and pointless, and then, on November 19, 1863,
Everything is so... white.
That everything's sticking in pretty well.
It's like everything's perfect.
This has been so much fun.
Everything is spectacular.
Everything's so time - consuming.
Everything seems like fun
Everything is just alive.
The stuff dreams are made of
Everything was confused and blurred. I didn't nnow what I was doing.
Everything was special
Everything's so bright, even at night.
And everything is gonna be just fine.
All kinds of weird shit.
And illit and full of fantasy.
And up above it's so fair
Everything shiny and beautiful and grand.
They're so real
And all of a sudden.
All of a sudden, I'm on it. Nice story.
Everything was always easy.
Everything's so wonderful.
Everything is unknown, virgin territory.
I am at peace.
It's very money - oriented, everybody worry about the living,
It's only money.
It's the money.
All are wrong
Nothing goes right... Nothing goes right.
Everything's negative.We obviously missed something.
Everything is a conspiracy theory! I protest.
All of them unfamiliar.
Everything washed fresh, a whole new cycIe.
There was this sort of freezing fog hanging over everything,
That all of this will remain off the record.
Deception is everything.
If it happened.
You order fancy food in advance of your arrival.
Everything is upside down
All are lies!
It's a trick.
It was all a fabrication of quilok.
Everything else the man has grabbed from us.
Everything's in black and white.
That everything will go wrong
It just seems unreal.
And things seem so sharp.
Everything seemed so important,
Everything seems to indicate close - contact gunshot wound.
And every indicator says it can't be done.
It's too late.
It's too late, mom.
But it's too late, my darling.
It was too late. I was already pregnant.
It's over.The sun has set.
Things change, you know.
Everything is out in the open.
Everything's exposed.
All the better.
Everything's better.
Everything's newer and brighter and bluer
Everything's tighter.
It's gonna be okay.
And everything's gonna go back to normal.
It's gonna be okay. All right, come on, let's get undressed, okay?
The whole thing.
You operate within an official structure.
You know its a process
There's a point to everything.
Always possible,
I've got everything down except for the timer.
Everything was a bit weird.
Everything I got people counting on it.
It's all in a good cause. That doesn't make it less embarrassing.
There's always a cost.
Everything has a purpose, Colonel, including the circumstances that brought me here.
You got everything covered，I think we can handle it.
Nothing lasts forever, not even a picture.
Always a possibility.
And anything was possible
All is possible. Everything.
And anything can happen
All the things that could have happened to have made you feel he had changed.
It could have been anything. I'm very upset.
It can happen. That is all I'm saying!
So anything's possible, right?
Mike things are looking up.
It's like you said it would be.
Things have way of changing.
But all things have their time.
Everything was going right on schedule.
Everything remains to be done.
Yes, everything will make sense.
All things in their proper order.
Nothing is disturbed. Perhaps they heard us.
There's a sense of purpose. We're a community.
Since that night,
Something's wrong about all this, Trust me.
Everything was slightly mad,
There's always the threat of everything falling apart.
There's always a first time.
This all makes sense. There were so many signs.
It must be nice having all the answers.
Everything could just cease to exist.
Everything is in order. The same doctor
Only clues.
It's everything. If there was one thing you could pick out you'd try to fix it,
Everything has a hidden meaning.
Everything was going right.
All very positive. Yeah.
Nothing ever changed.
Everything was gonna be fine, it was just going to be this stupid little secret
It's too late.
All in good time.
It just all happened so fast.
It's all happening too soon. You moving in.
It's all happening so fast and it sort of feels like it has nothing to do with me.
Out of the blue.
Having all this happen at once, A marriage, a baby,
Like it came so natural.
Everything is happening so quickly...
How slow all of a sudden.
It got very real very fast and I panicked.
The history of the problem
The same area where all that happened.
It all went down pretty fast, I mean.
It'll all come naturally. Isn't that right, Pullo?
Everything comes from the East.
It all came from the stars, but how?
Who owes everything to some unknown alien scientist
A dumbing down.
Everything checked out. Sounds like you had a pretty tough day.
Yeah, it's over.
They're all labelled in terms of time.
That everything will happen when you want it,
Everything glittered and was golden.
And it will all come true.
Things have been great now
Everything's hunky - dory， because you got me in the sack
Everything was kind of fuzzy.
All a blur of sparkly.
And things were booming along.
We got it going on.
That would be this working.
It was just getting good.
Everything's changing.
Everything comes back normal.
Ready for normalcy. - good.
Things in common, old friends.
Everything's all right， Just calm down. I am calm. I'm calm.
Everything fine?
Is everything all right? This isn't about me, right?
Is everything okay? What? Nothing's wrong.
Everything all right, madam?
Is everything all right, ma'am? What do you want?
Is everything all right, ma'am ?- what do you want?
Is everything okay?
Is everything okay? Oh, my God.
Is everything all right? I think so
And everything's cool, right?
Everything's fine. This is true.
Everything seemed fine.
Everything was fine until her phone rang.
Have they been normal？
Everything all right? Fine.
Well, everything is on track.
Everything's dead, Lincoln.
Everything is dead quiet, it seems almost eerie.
Everything is fucked.
It's totally ruined,
Ruined everything!
It's all been spoiled and wasted,
That's how the whoIe thing got screwed up. I broke the covenant.
You have ruined everything
Totally in ruins!
There is nothing to worry about.
Everything's brighter than it was a week ago.
Everything's much easier than for us.
Everything was so much more amazing than I could've imagined.
It all went faster than planned.
There was no ambiguity!
It all feeIs so random... What we're doing？
It just strikes suddenly， without warning.
It all means so little.
Have gone right back into her hands, don't you think?
Somehow you know when the time is right.
Zat explains everything!
It's never too late.
And the gibes of all
Everything is gone.
Is everything... Gone?
The breeze all
It's all gone now. Everything I ever made.
Everything's gone but the Lise insurance.
This is it, mark.
Everything's going great today.
And everything turned out okay.
Everything's all right
So things are all right?
Everything's all right now. My dearest.
Everything's all right. Just calm down
It will be okay, Anna.
Things are fine now. I ran a test.
Everything will be all right. Trust me.
That everything is okay.
Everything's fine. You need rest.
And everything is okay.
Hey, everything okay?
Everything all right? Did that tremor throw off the system?
Everything cool here, baby? - you remember Seymour.
Is everything okay? Absolutely.
Everything's fine. There's an ambulance on the way already.
Everything's gonna be OK.
It's all good, babe.
Everything's alright! Calm down!
It's all right, little ones.
Everything's alright I'm here
Everything's fine. Thanks.
It is what it is.
It was pretty uneventful.
So we're all good there.
Got you at the end of the day.
well, that's all right
It's okay... Fly first class.
It's all about the variables.
Nothing is ready.
It never happened.
None of it's happening.
It's all still there.
Nothing's changed, huh?
Nothing has changed, has it?
Nothing's been decided yet. The autopsy report
It was all just for nothing!
This doesn't make any sense anymore.
For either of us, did they?
It hasn't changed. Let's go.
So we lost everything? We never had everything.
Everything was all right.
It is not ready.
It hasn't happened.
It didn't all happened. It was all planned, right?
It's always now.
Too many things haven't changed. Like what?
It would never stop.
We had no warning I was doing dishes when I got the call
All are nonsense
It means nothing.
Nothing matters.
Kiss of the bitch.
It's meaningless, she's suffocating.
Nothing has gone according to the goddamn plan!
And nothing is going the way we planned.
Always just stays the same!
But nothing has changed
No change.
Nothing's changing, you know,
Nothing has changed. I'm still a pig, you're still a human vacuum cleaner.
Everything's fine. These things take time.
Everything will be fine. Oatmeal's ready.
Nothing works.
Nothing is working.
Everything isn't so fixed.
And everything would be all right.
Nothing's wrong,
Everything is fine, and everything is completely normal.
It'll all be taken care of.
Everything's all right. You'll be all right.
That nothing's wrong right now?
Things are cool, aren't they, mum?
Is everything okay?
Everything all right in there? don't come in.
Is everything all right, doctor?
I'll check this with the manager. Mr. Murdock.
Everything's fine. I went out with your sister.
That's absolutely no problem.
It's all right,
Everything's fine, all you gotta do is stand up.
Everything is gonna be okay. I know it.
Everything's fine, aunt Josephine.
All right, everything checks out, so let's get you paid.
Now I can't.
It's in his blood.
Well, everything's coming up us, kid.
Everything was dead and not a soul was Ieft in the world.
Like everything else.
That everything's away now
Everything is fading. We're no longer here.
That that's it, it's over?
Everything fell apart. He couldn't write anymore.
When all seems lost, the future unknowable,
Have all passed away.
Everything got all off.
Everything was made clear.
Everything went white.
Everything clear? Perfectly clear.
And it was just as clear as day.
It's been wiped clean.
Things are looking up, Giselle.
All from one...
It all begins with a curse.
It comes in their dreams.
It all started with your $200, let's show him how to gamble.
It aII started on the streets of Detroit,
It was all a little bet we made to see just how gullible you could be.
All of this started when I put this ring on my finger.
It all started with the book. A book?
This all began on the train to Cardiff, appropriately enough,
Everything depends on that code. Did you understand anything?
Is everything satisfactory?
Is everything satisfactory? Everything except the interruption.
Everything looks beautiful. Thanks.
Everything became this big conspiracy.
Everything dies.
Everything was destroyed.
Could end?
It just went up like that,
Everything is nailed in our memory,
And everything gets cleaned away.
Every plan I had vanished.
Everything burns
Everything will be swell then.
I did everything you asked.
Everything was done as it was supposed to be done.
It's all right here, honey.
Everything is on straight ahead. In fact don't tell anyone.
Everything is kept just as Mrs. De winter liked it.
Everything's worked out just as we'd hoped.
Make sure you lock everything up good, all right?
This is done by the book.
All protocol was followed, sir.
It was done by the book until you rewrote it!
Everything is complete as planned.
It's all going to plan. He's half in love with her already.
Everything just went out.
Impregnable to about anything but artillery.
Everything is looking different now.
We're all his
And it's understood
It's all okay. It 'sokay because I turned thirty today.
Water brings on an explosion of life
We have looked through everything.
My name's on everything, right?
I guess it all begins with a scientist.
Everything is done up by cellphone.
And that it's out of his control.
Leader of everything.
Everything is in the hands of the gods.
You're choosing everything.
That was decided by your votes last night.
To even begin to make things up to you.
And it's on your conscience.
It's ours for the taking.
It's all done through our nonprofit corporation.
And do all of it without a corporation
We've taken care of everything? We've just hired a valet and confirmed a caterer.
I'll do everything.
I'm gonna take care of all this. You have nothing to worry about, all right?
And I will make all the arrangements.
I'll do all the work. I got us that building back there.
And that's how this works, okay?
I've got this under control.
My great grand father Sozin happend.
Everything's going digital.
He does everything electronically.
Everything goes to my next of kin. What about you?
Everything is crazy now.
Than the best of humanity.
And everything's pointing to fifth column.
Everything's the same.
Everything would have been fine if you'd just...
Everything worked for me, up until the chapter on your first campaign.
Everything's fairly dire.
It's in God's hands now.
There's a lot riding on this night. Not just for me.
I guess the radish is in your basket now.
You're taking all the chances.
It's up to you now. Here we go. Here we go.
So much depends on this working out.
Well, everything looks good except for one thing.
Makes everything a painting.
It all looks fantastic, man.
Everything looks in order.
All seems very neat and peaceful, doesn't it?
Everything looks delicious.
None of this looks familiar. Are you sure we're going the right way?
It's just the straight from it to certain death.
Everything really will be over.
Everything is getting really scary and really crazy.
This is real, and this is gonna be your new life.
You may find that hard to believe,
Everything's coloured, everything, you know？
Everything comes out.
Everything breaks.
Things fall apart.
Everything's falling apart I've lost my wife, my daughters, my onetime mistress, my son.
This is so messed up.
Everything's all messed up. What's messed up?
Things are wrapping up, so I'm betting it's soon.
It will meet in secret, if your Majesty agrees.
Everything's been orderly, and it's all gone like clockwork.
Hubby's dead, the cubs have been slaughtered,
It all happened real fast.
It sort of turned into a reenactment of the inquisition.
Everything that points to the profile,
Everything's still holding within operational parameters.
Everything on the up-and-up ?
It fits everything but the nosebleed.
Simplifies everything. You get your life back.
If things would've been easier.
Let's just get this over with, Cartman.
Everything is accounted for fairy godmother except for one potion. What?
Everything counts.
But everything is going well.
Everything pretty much sucks.
You know, as awful as all of this is
Everything's going to shit right now, OK?
And it was all a little bit rubbish.
Everything's faliing apart
Things get really bad!
Everything's going to hell, Ernie.
Everything's bad now, I know... - stop talking.
Sort of stretched.
Everything is tested and ready for use.
Nothing is left to chance.
It fits together.
All to be over
It's done.
After everything you've done,
All finished.
And so it ended.
But it's all over now.
He's throwing in the towel.
Issue closed?
It's all over
That's it, man.
The mass has ended. Go in peace to love and serve the Lord.
This game over? Game's not over.
Everything is over! Everything is over!
It was done. Less than a minute.
It's over. don't come to my house, don't touch me.
It's all over. Daniel's accepted and handed in his keys
It's over. Why don't you give it a rest?
It's all over, honey.
It's over, baby. You missed. - That's charitable of you.
Then it's over. All of this is meaningless.
It's over. You don't understand. They made me do it.
It's over. You're out.
It's all over. What's your name?
All is done now. You can go off and love your husband,
It's over. I'm your only hope.
All are finished, you get what you want
Then it's all over do whatever you want
It's over. Are you crazy?
It's over. You know that, right?
It is done. You are free, my love.
It's over, and you're under arrest.
It's over, brother. It's over. OK.
It's done, senior Garza.
It's over, doc. There's nowhere to go.
It's over, Jim.
It's over I will decide when it's over
It's over，Spence
It's over. Agreed.
Is it over?
So the game's up. The chickens have come home to roost.
It was all over in less than a minute.
It's over. Good.
It's over! - that was easy.
It's over! That was easy.
It's over. She's gonna die.
It's over. She's gone.
It's over. She knows it.
It is over, sister.
It's over, honey.
It's all over. - so that's it? Then we failed?
Case closed. Let's shoot them.
It's over.
It's over. It shortly will be, yeah.
It's over, Gusano. Let Dakota go.
Now that it's over, I don't want to talk about it any more.
It's over, I'm not running anymore.
It's done, and I'm sorry for everything.
It's gone, and I'm coming home.
This is the end. We're all doomed.
It's all over with now. We might as well not even show up to graduation.
We're finished. It's over we're done.
It's so over. And it was wrong.
And that's final. I decide what's final!
It's over. I'm finished.
It's over. - I knew it.
That's over. I signed the divorce papers.
This is over! I'm take her in.
Then it's over. I didn't call the police, but don't push me.
It's over. I'm go home now.
This is it. I'm letting him go.
It's over. I win.
It's over, Dana.
It's over. So if you just...
That's it. Shoot him, robo.
It's over, Tom! Put down your weapon!
It's all over. It's OK. It's over.
It's over. - no.
It's over. Fuck you!
And it's over and then he calls four times in one morning.
It's over, Trevor.
It's over, Marietta. Mandy and I were a terrible mistake， I've come back foryou.
It is all over, momon.
What we do now？ that it's over.
It's over, Percy.
It's over.
It's over, Jean.
They're past, pimenov. It's finished.
Now, it's over and it's been an incredible journey
It's over, Forster.
It's over, Costa, you're under arrest.
End of the line, Millicent.
Party's over, Miro!
Now that it's all over, after this incredible ordeal, what are your feelings?
It's over. It's over.
No way we survive this. Death is coming!
It's over, Eddie.
It's over. Come with me.
Is over, done with and forgotten, okay?
I'm done here. - you're not done here.
It's over, it's over.
It's over... So over.
It's over. And unless you want the whole world to know you run a high - class prostitute ring,
So what are you gonna do when all this is over?
When this is all over, why don't you do it?
When this is over, you're gonna do something for me. - what?
We'll leave this place together when all of this is over.
Once this whole thin is over and done, we're gonna get back there.
I'll tell you when it's over.
Now when this is all over, you need to tell me where you're registered.
It's all over, my princess.
I'll see you when it's all over.
Of what's gonna happen to me when all this comes to an end.
When all this is over, someone's buying the first round.
At the end, I mean.
You can have everything.
Everything has been arranged.
Has everything been explained to you?
Everything's ready for you. Thank you.
It's the undertaking.
It was really nice.
It's so passe.
Couldn't be a lot of words?
It's all connected. Shut up.
We have the chain.
Everything comes out exact.
So everything can start over.
I mean is to go back and start over.
And things can stay the way they are.
And everything goes back to normal.
They say that things will be okay,
Is it as good as we hoped?
Thing that'll work out.
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung
Everything can wait, we must search.
Everything can stay the same.
Can solve everything.
Which way our hearts will go.
Meant we could always be that open.
Everything else gets shorted.
The whole deck's gonna be reshuffled. Seven, six, five.
You sure that thing's gonna hold you up?
You stayed after all the others deserted.
And everything somehow seems right.
The curtain falls. An iron curtain.
So all this was for nothing.
Kept it inside didn't tell no - one else.
With everything staring down at us,
Those moments where everything sort of comes together.
Everything working?
All factors suggest he has nothing to lose.
Everything about this guy says he was on the up - and - up.
Probably cost him a stripe. So where's the diamonds and the bassinets, huh?
It was bad work all around. I'll take the heat.
Everything points to someone who fled after the shooting.
All of which would suggest that Moriarty may be right.
You look totally in control
Everything was already done by the native people 2,000 years ago
everything hurts so bad
And you messed it all up.
And ruined everything!
You ruined everything.
Everything is squeezed for you
You were right - about everything.
The hillside was like ice cream.
Everything was cold and frozen.
Everything's frozen.
Everything has been taken away. So that really sent me into a tail spin.
She's destroying everything!
It's already decided.
I'm the only one doing any work here.
Everything's shit, dad.
Everything is being twisted into a sort of tunnel shape.
All totally wiped down. Almost like it was...
They've taken everything. - not quite everything.
Everything has been destroyed.
So everything was destroyed?
It changes everything.
It changes everything
Everything was inventoried.
Everything is ruined.
And, in fact everything has been cleaned up and put away.
Everything charred virtually beyond recognition.
Everything's been approved, so we're on.
Everything was restricted, everything was censored.
Everything is backwards now, like out there is the true world
And all in darkness.
By the time you get back.
It all started when.
It started a little over a year ago.
I had to learn everything all over again, you know?
It all starts with the starlight scope,
Everything's going to change now, isn't it?
Because it's always about you.
Does everything have to be about you?
It's important that everything look right.
We relied on it for everything.
Everything had to be confidential.
Everything is classified there
Now just keep it simple. Just like we practice.
And all with the strength of that rose.
Everything has to be moved up
Everything's coming apart.
Everything must be perfect.
It all depends on other people.
Everything is going to change.
Okay, move on, Angela!
The attending takes the lead.
Everyone must obey orders
You'll be doing what the doctors say. Got it?
And I am now calling the shots.
And he wants it by tomorrow night.
Everything's coming to an end.
That everything's perfect for Mr. Debris
Perfection, people.
I want to make sure everything is perfect.
All must hurry. This will all be over in moments.
Everything should just be on the table.
Everything has to be cleaned.
Everything receives a spit and a polish.
She wants fabulous that is her simple request
I want fabulous that is my simple request
And it's thanks to her.
I have to do everything!
I'm trying to do it by myself. I can't just pull up stakes and take off by myself.
I need to do it on my own.
Everything is packed
Everything must to be your way.
Everything was going according to the little girl's plan,
Your informant is making all the rules.
And everything was going to plan.
Everything in its proper box.
All that was going to change.
That's all gonna change.
It's all going to change.
I want only dummy text and up on that wall.
Everything must be fast, loud, noisy
Find out everything about her, and bring her to me tonight.
Everything is fucked up.
Everything washed a whole new cycle.
This is happening according to our way.
It was imperative that everything went according to plan.
We do everything in writing.
Everything depends on what you make of this opportunity.
It wasn't me it was you
Wait until we are in uniform, my boy.
It all ends here.
This has to end.
It was curtains and everybody knew it, but nobody said so.
End of the line, cool breeze.
Everything steamed, organic and germ - free.
Everything needs to be destroyed. Every last bolt.
Everything's got to be perfect for.
Thanks for everything. Pleasure.
Everything in moderation.
It'll all be quick.
This plays out by the book. Not in a back room with a rubber hose.
There are laws.
All hunched up, pretending to be so damned understanding.
It all had to be very discreet
You have to make every move your own.
That's what makes the whole thing work.
It all depends on the heat shield.
It's amazing what you can come to take for normal.
Everything is in its place.
Everything is solved.
Everything's worked out, you're going to the convention.
It's all been sorted out. Back to normal.
Everything's settled. I fixed it.
Everything's fine, dad. We decided not to go.
Well, we got it all worked out, sweetie!
It closes the circle.
It's all for all real.
It's all for real
It's all for real, I'm telling you just how I feel,
It's all in play.
Well, it was all slotting into place
Planning so that I don't brake unnecessarily.
Everything's timed out to perfection.
Everything's been worked out so the image hits the right spot.
Everything's booked. So the really big question is where are we going to stay?
All this gives me a stomachache.
He got everything.
Say everything that's upsetting you.
Whatever comes next.
It's terrifying for me.
And I'm just thrilled about everything.
I ruined everything.
Refreshing.
It was never dull.
It all makes sense.
Everything's set. Where'd she find him?
All the right notes.
All confirming that he is not my son.
It just goes to show - vulgar.
Let's stop all this.
Everything is rational.
And everything is supposed to be perfect.
Everything is supposed to end.
Let's get this thing over with...
All shall be forgotten.
All that's forgotten?
All shall be forgotten? You don't say.
None of this makes any sense. He just hurt his arm, dad.
Makes perfect sense.
I mean it all adds up.
And it appears they worked as a team.
Everything about this place stinks of "government ops".
That's all there is to it.
It all makes sense now.
It all makes so much sense.
Everything's been negotiated.
Thanks for everything.
Everything is totally clear now.
And it was all out in the open?
It all makes sense now, doesn't it?
Being where you supposed to be. You believe in that?
And has somehow made it look like you did it.
Everything looked clear like glass.
It all seems so long ago
Being in the right place.
It all started with the gangs. You know, people tend to forget that.
It started here with a vow to never let this happen again.
It all began with the very first molecule.
It all began Able's garage.
Than you can possibly imagine, because he loves you.
Everything is just super.
Things are finally back to normal.
It could be forever and ever and ever.
This was rock bottom.
Everything is exactly the way it was before.
Everything turned out the way you wanted.
Everything that follows is a result of what you see here.
It was about who you are, what you are, or what you believe in.
It happened just like you said it would.
It's all got to do with the rabbit's foot.
And how this all connects to the mayor.
Everything's been just like usual.
Is everything like usual?
Oh, because it's all about luck.
Everything out here has to be sexualized.
Nothing like I thought it would be.
That's just how I dreamed of it.
Everything's exactly the way I left it.
Everything just like on my funny little map.
It all has to do with Warner Kaminsky.
You're so dramatic.
This has everything to do with the cops.
It's about the money.
It's about food.
It's in the shadows.
The context shifts. Things you thought were luxuries become essential.
Everything's over so quickly
It all goes into the computer and gets sent back to network.
Everything's up to code.
Everything passes on.
All have past
All in the past.
All that's gone now. Can I call you next weekend?
After all that's passed, knowing all you know now.
Is it all over?
Well, it's all working out, huh?
It's gone. What happened to it?
It's all over now. Think about me.
It's over, now we can get on with the rest of our lives.
Passing is passing.
Everything's all right. I'm going to take you home.
All is forgiven, my little ladybug.
That was low, going over my head like that.
It's over. Dad!
So this is over. Finished.
Let it go, Maurice.
It's over, okay?
It's all for the best. All for the best.
There, there.
And now it's over, and we're just friends.
I feel like time will go by and we'll all run into each other
It's already started. This is it.
Just all went by so fast.
And that problem disappears.
Have worked pretty good.
Everything is pretty and perfect.
Everything's perfectly normal.
Everything is still the same.
Until we have gathered the rest.
Everything is so uncertain! Sir William says my life is still in danger.
That's a good thing, right?
Is it too late, darling?
Are you settling all right?
Everything would still be running normally.
Because they live in my memory.
And things would be just like they were? Thanks for making the time.
I don't feel like anything is missing.
It's still a work in progress, but Rome wasn't built in a day.
Everything is still operational. The emergency system is already rerouting power.
Boy, everything looks so good.
Everything all right in here?
Is everything okay? Were you worried about little about me?
Everything is OK? Very well.
Everything okay? It's great, thanks.
Everything's okay, but you gotta stay still. Where's Sam?
Things were going well until she wanted to...
Is everything okay with... - waffles.
Uh, well, everything is okay, but we have no way to leave.
Yeah, it's all right, so long as you keep your head down and do your bird.
Everything all right up there?
To make sure everything was okay.
We okay?
That make everything okay now?
Is everything okay, Giovanni?
Is everything okay, honey?
Is everything okay? Your son?
Everything okay? You been going to your doctor's appointments?
How's everything going? What do you think?
Is everything okay, sir?
Everything go all right, lieutenant?
Is everything okay with... Waffles.
Is everything alright, Mrs Goodfellow?
Everything all right? Uh, not exactly.
Is everything all right? Oh, yes, indeed.
Is everything okay? Yeah, yeah. Sorry, sorry.
Everything all right? Yeah, I'm just doing some thinking.
How did everything go? - great!
Is everything okay? No, I'm fine.
Is everything all right? Angela, I have to go to my brother's for a while.
Everything okay over there, pen?
Everything cool? I'm cool, man.
Is everything fabulous? Yes. I didn't know you were here.
Is everything okay, Dexter?
Is everything okay? We just got a call from the alarm company.
Is everything all right? Did we do something wrong?
Is it all set? Hope so.
Everything okay? - I'm good.
Everything good here? Just fine.
Everything okay? - yeah, these gentlemen were just leaving.
Everything alright? - yeah.
Everything's OK? yes.
Is everything okay? - I'm fine.
Is it going well? Yes.
Is everything okay? Oh, yeah. Everything's good.
Is everything okay here? Yeah, thanks.
Is everything all right? Yes, thank you.
Is everything okay? What's the situation?
Everything come out okay? Splendid. I'm fine.
Is everything okay? It's nothing important.
Is everything okay? It is now.
Everything OK? Can I help?
So, everything worked out OK? - yeah, thank God.
How's everything? Everything's good.
Is everything okay? It's fine.
Is everything okay? Is there anything inside me?
Everything all right down there?
Everything alright?
Hey, is everything all right,
How are... How are things?
I hope everything's OK.
Everything okay? Nothing's okay.
Everything all right, darling? Oh, terrific. I'm just eating.
Is everything okay? He took his first step.
Everything okay? Would you like to talk? About?
Is everything okay? What are you thinking about?
Is everything all right, ma`am，what do you want?
Is everything okay, Clark?
Everything okay? It's really sad with the closure.
Is everything okay? Did something happen?
Is everything okay? What's the matter?
Everything all right, senator?
Everything okay? - Oh, yeah, things are great.
Everything okay?
Everything all right? Yeah, everything's fine.
Oh, is everything okay? Yeah, it's just the usual.
Everything okay, Nightjar? Anything I need to know?
Everything okay, Signora?
Everything okay? - it's great, thanks.
How's things? How are the kids?
So, is everything OK, little girl?
Is everything all right here, Brenda? Yeah.
Is everything all right? - sure.
Is everything okay? Yeah, why?
Is everything all right? I don't know, annik.
Was everything okay? - I lost her for a little bit.
Everything all right? I thought I saw an argument.
Is everything okay? I mean, you're not having any problems, are you?
Everything okay? I don't want to talk to her right now.
Is everything okay? What do you have on Bertrand?
Everything okay? Sorry.
Are things going okay? Yes.
Everything OK? Yeah. I'm just tired.
Is everything okay? Oh, yes, fine.
Everything okay? Yes, it's wonderful here.
Everythingall right here, folks? Great. Thank you.
Everything okay over there ?
Is everything okay, dad? - not bad.
Everything's under control. Everything is just fine.
The wean's all right. That's not the point!
Is everything all right? Yeah, yeah.
Have you had quiet guard?
Everything is fuzzy.
It's just fate.
My parade shall be quite dry under my umbrella!
Everything is just so by the numbers.
We still don't know anything for sure.
It's mysterious.
Seems like everything's going back exactly the way it was.
You are seeing nothing yet.
Well, everything's unpacked.
Near the border of Afghanistan.
All that needs to be done,
Nothing wrong?
Everything seemed okay until Wednesday night.
It's not over.
It's not yet too late.
Nothing's set in stone yet. So, you're not denying it.
This isn't over.
This isn't over, you mark my words.
Things aren't finished, right?
Is everything alright? You scoundrels want me to die.
Is everything to your satisfaction?
Is everything in order? Yes.
Is everything... - right now!
It's all being arranged right now.
Nothing will have settled down, yet.
Well, that's all fine and dandy
Everything okay here?
Are you guys okay?
Yeah, thank you.
Is everything all right, darling?
So, everything's going okay with you.
How's everything going? Yeah, good. You want a seat?
Everything all right? No, it fucking isn't all right.
Everything is so messed up.
It's perfect.
Everything so new and exciting.
Everything is so crisp and clear and beautiful
It's all new and fresh and exciting.
Everything was normal？
Everything is so perfect
Everything's such a mess.
It's just beautiful.
Everything is so beautiful.
Everything's so nice and romantic.
It all slipped away.
Everything's so black.
Everything's so dark.
Everything rests in the graveyard.
All in a better place.
I mean everything was booming, okay?
And everything was going off without a hitch.
And it all worked out quite well
Everything was going great.
It's all falling together perfectly.
This is all working out for the best
This is all happening too fast.
And everything was going great.
Everything was running smoothly, except for one small detail.
And things were progressing, if you know what I mean.
I'm taking my time.
And I was having a real impact until...
You take everything in stride.
Everything is moving so quickly, it will be nice to slow it down.
All going very well actually.
And that's successful,
When everything doth make a gleeful boast?
That's worked really, really well.
And everything is going perfect. We'll see you there?
Everything was going great till the gardener showed up.
Everything's going fine, okay? Stop worrying.
Everything's going just fine.
It isn't over till it's over.
Everything is linked.
It's all coming together.
Is everything okay, dad? Not bad.
She likes she knows everything.
I see everything.
Everything gradually regained normalcy. Only my brother, My son.
Getting near the road again.
Everything was going through.
And everything is terrible.
What we used to call functionalism.
Everything obeys all the laws of physics and logic.
With everything laid out in an orderly fashion?
Everything was so bad.
And all the same things
And this was cloudier.
Everything is so serious.
Everything's so tedious.
None of it made any sense.
It's all so confusing. Who knows?
Everything is strange
And everything's great, but it's only a matter of time
Everything is so good, We're going great.
Everything seems funny, it all looks good.
All the trimmings!
And your life will be perfect.
Everything perfect, everyone happy,
It happened all so slowly.
So fresh and exciting
Everything got done so quickly.
And it's all so dramatic,
And everything just sounds so interesting,
All been very interesting, hasn't it?
It was so romantic.
It was messed up
Everything was so clear.
It's all so boring.
It all feels too familiar
It was all so real.
Everything so far, so far away.
All very authentic.
It's so true and I owe it all to you
Everything's simple. I mean you don't play games.
Everything's just gone so wrong.
None of this is okay.
Every pebble here is filled with magnificence.
It was just so natural.
It's all very cosy.
All have ourselves a real big laugh.
You had such lovely things.
Everything is so good.
It's all obvious.
And everything was bright
It all just feels so arbitrary.
It all worked perfectly until that kiss.
Had been anything but,
Everything is fine.
Everything is full of dust,
All that's been lost.
And it got everything wrong!
With everything going so wrong, you have to wonder,
This is wrong. This is so wrong.
It all began one Tuesday after school.
Everything shines.
And that's when everything changed,
This changes everything.
Let things go their way.
Everything was buried with him.
And... Let go?
Everything is coming up Carlos!
That they'll never be the same.
Nothing can ever escape
Everything was just focused on the future all the time. And now.
Everything will be on the test and the test will be everything.
All things are made anew.
And everything stopped.
Have all passed away
It all happened very publicly.
And it's all down to very innovative stuff, like the fuel tank, which is very shallow and very long,
Everything is perfectly fine.
Oh, it's going... Great!
We're perfect.
Everything is amazing. We deserve high - fives.
It was quiet and oncentrated.
It went perfectly.
Everything is chaos and all gone to hell. How did it get to be Iike this?
Everything is chaos. It's all gone to hell. How did it get to be like this?
It was all very clear.
Everything is very gratifyingly... Okay.
Which would be completely romantic and amazing,
This is so simple.
And things seem to be going great
Everything had gone very very well,
It all rests on him.
But I know that I can depend on you,
It's all riding chickon you, champ.
I'm counting on you. You gotta keep him busy until I can get everyone together.
Everything depends upon you, my dear brother,
You're all I can count on，Thank you.
It's all you.
It's all up to us, isn't it?

She had this look of awe. She said it's him.
To pull something like this.
Like whoa!
You act like somebody died
One set of hard front wings and a set of soft hind wings, used for flying.
A night - vision binocular
A large dose of potassium chloride can result in a fatal heart attack.
How about a pair of sunglasses?
An occupied vessel but powerless.
Something's off.
When he looks like some big business blowhard -
A really good voice, you know, we blend well.
Seems like a nice mom.
A ll skeleton penetrated by 12 prods.
You have perfect teeth.
Shyly looking away and thrusting your chest out is natural?
It's a little coffin.
A pair of cheap sunglasses is less suspicious
A rainbow colored parasail and it was on my head.
Really good dancers.
A comprehensive picture
All sad and tortured - I see why you like him.
All damsel in distress like.
Like he thought it was funny, like this.
A common and everyday's scene from London streets.
And he seems quite happy
Acted like he was a sensitive artist, but he was "in love" with a lot of girls.
With an air of contentment.
Very proud.
From being included in his spotlight.
He wasn't quite there.
How can each one take two hours? Do - Suk, you can never do that much
Well, that's a weird look.
Like she's trying to get to know them or something.
I love you.
I already learned to live alone.
And judge me like l'm some kind of criminal.
He's compensating - all this bossiness.
Oh, no I'm too cool to be in love.
There's five fingers on a glove.
Uh, one half of a couple all of a sudden.
How about a pair of handcuffs?
A deck of cards, a bird or a man.
Pack of cards. Nothing funny about them.
A stretcher, No problem.
With a vehicle versus pedestrian collision.
A new glider. This is amazing.
A new pair of reading glasses. They're from Malaysia.
You got a new body, a new life.
A new face,
One of my priceless oil paintings
Know it all.
Like it was nothing at all.
You always appear exhausted.
One boring blue boy in a painfully boring painting.
You're like one of those victims
They're ready to deal. They're practically begging for a deal.
She certainly looks perky.
Which is in itself a living thing.
I could do all this with a pair of binoculars and a thermal vest.
A pair of binoculars and $40 in cash?
Hoping he'll glance over here.
Looking like his favorite cat just died.
I am a pervert.
Nothing gets me talking like a Cosmo.
A carnal shell
You probably don't even care.
She's just bland like her pictures are okay,
And then pretend to be so very unengaged?
Like that 'll help you think.
Showing off is what it is.
As if love transforms people and changes molecules.
A deck of cards, a bird, or a man.
A deck of cards, pack of marlboros,
Every position in the deck is a location in my memory palace.
How many 2S in a deck? Four.
The bald little sycophant that he is.
As if her life was over.
It's a man's face.
He looked awful.
And a climbing harness.
A picture of the emperor
Pair of glasses. Oh, here's another cat.
Yeah, real tough guys.
Complete sell out mode.
Criminal types. Those were his words.
Criminal types. Those were his words. And big into Santa Muerte.
Mr. Nice guy, the car, the Romeo stuff.
Old and rich.
An earring. I found it.
The floaty face of the wise bird, hovering on a million quotes,
A portraiture.
You see a film 100 times. There's nothing else to do.
That "Nora has a plan" look.
And a pair of those special gloves that 'll let me handle the wire.
To achieve a sound that impress the voters.
And a set of leg chains to keep you slowed down just a little bit.
Thinking they had all the answers?
Walking around acting like they're better than us.
And act like they the stuff. What?
The walk of a self-satisfied Persian prince.
Hungry little guy, smells like horses.
What about matching lace gloves?
Full of piss and vinegar,
With his tie and his stickpin.
A misguided sense of revenge.
Beaten down by a cruel employer.
All prepared to be devastated about it.
Wanted to make sure I heard his side of the story.
Always on the attack. It's ugly,
A pencil drawing of Pele, done in the naive primitive style.
Just ready to go.
A shell, an addict, who could possibly Dieof his addictionunless something changes.
I can't be a wuss and drive at the same time.
Verging on haunted.
With her stupid - ass file of evidence, and I told her,
And a pair of those special gioves that'll Iet me handle the wire.
A pair of those special gloves that I'll let me handle the wire
Picked herself up county clothes,
I have a real nice voice.
With an extremely cold heart is still here?
And gloves that look like rocks.
A mask. - that's the welder's mask we found at the scene.
Face like a bust shoe.
A gut shot straight draw? Are you kidding me?
Invasion of the citiots.
A bridle and a saddle
As in a skeleton in the basement of the house you and dad owned.
And a pair of bIack gioves.
All Zhivago like,
It's absolutely me, and I can't pass the buck.
The lawyers in my office.
As soon as that's done, we're gone.
One right does not make up for a life time worth of wrongs
1 plus 1, even.
So one plus one.
Why isn't there a boiler in boilermaker?
One plus one equals three.
One plus one makes two.
One plus one, does it make one?
One plus three should give us four, green.
One plus three equals two?
A plus B equals a tie in.
One plus five equals six.
A gallon of vodka and a lit cigarette.
Gallon gonna be enough? You been looking at my house?
Which at about 8.3 pounds a gallon comes to.
Yeah, a gallon. OK, that should be.
one gallon of stove oil,
How much does a gallon of water weigh?
What kind of gas mileage do you get with this?
60 miles to the gallon.
Twenty - five miles to the gallon. That's great.
Four miIes to the gallon?
What's it get like a mile and a half to the gallon?
Fifty - seven miles to the gallon.
And it gets 30 miles a gallon, city.
A situation incited by a gallon of sake,
Of bleach, a tarp and a hacksaw in the trunk of my car.
300 miles a gallon and the engine will run like one half its age.
The gallon milk jugs which are the high - density polyethylene.
A single gulp would suffice.
33 miles to the gallon.
A gallon of wheat grass juice, a five - pound wad of tofu, some jellied zinc.
Once you're in,they got you for life.
And as soon as we add the yeast, because it's been dehydrated,

Don't you move a muscle.
And still.
Did nothing.
So still,
wouldn't move, wouldn't talk.
Motionless, without touching me.
Not moving.
And he hasn't moved.
Very still and very quiet, until it's fading away,
Looking to pin the butterfly?
He's real still and I'm thinking "why is he so still?"
He's real still and I'm thinking,
You stay driest by standing still, and the faster you move the wetter you become.
He's not even moving
Sticky hands and no manners flanking our door?
Resting it lightly on her shoulder.
It won't budge. Forget it.
The best thing is to do nothing. We're at war. We must act.
Is no turning around.
Don't move, okay?
Face downward.
She was just lying there, small as a bird.
Frozen and I'll walk out of here with my buddies and that 'll be that.
She's completely paralyzed.
So stay very very still and hold your breath.
Hold it right there.
Don't you move a muscle. Don't you move.
And yielding
You move and there's no telling what they're gonna do.
We move him, mine explode.
Stop right there!
A big house. A huge garden.
Moving makes space will make you sink
Any movement and this whole field lights up. Now move the men back.
If you move, somebody might get hurt.
Feels like someone's grinding an ice pick into my ribs every time I move.
Every time I move, it hurts.
I can flip from its back to its feet in one move
Kill me tell me.
In the middle there.
Frozen.
A zoo breeder was killed by a gorilla
Forever.
It's permanent!
Once and all and forever.
Once and for all.
Be done with it. What? No,no.
Ten generations in the future.
Not do a day?
Just get it over .
And take down Galactica once and for all.
Birth control for an entire nation at once!
To crack down on the uprising once and for all.
For good? Like a cure?
The score of a lifetime.
To temporary problems.
One spoon.
And spoon - fed me that bullshit, and I ate it up!
One cream. Two sugars.
A splash of milk, 2 sugars. That's me.
One sugar and just a drop of cream.
One sugar, right?
A spoonful of crushed sugar puffs,
One for you. Two!
Peanut butter on a spoon?
One of honey.
Just one, thank you.
One scoop or two?
A 10 franc bag of chips and two francs of mayonnaise,
Pack of 12, two missing.
Comes in packages of four, but insanely...
Cases and cases gone.

Suddenly, the whereabouts of Jonathan cold are no longer recorded.
Before they knew it, the band was getting offers all over.
It would take too long to explain it.
And suddenly, whose life are you saving now?
Within that second, I couldn't think of one optimistic thing to say to her.
For a minute, l thought he was you.
For a moment my hands were not my own,
Slipped and fell on him and killed him stone dead.
I don’t have a suitable candidate just yet
Going over some options.
A whim?
Fuel to the fire.
For kicks? Economics.
A whim. Maybe not such a good idea.
On a whim.
The whims, the demands, the athletic assignations.
I just came by on impulse.
Heat of the moment... And all that.
On a whim, I pulled the financial records on the residents from the home who passed away over the last few years.
Impulsively purchased talking level, check.
Fleeting? As in, say, a passing fancy?
It's a phase.
Little biter and my behavior in a moment of passion
I crash landed in a Louisiana swamp
Just had this impulse.
Sudden heat?
Well, things happen in the heat of the moment.
And, in a moment of passion.
One of those impulses that grabs you, but so far we're okay.
Don’t you have any self - control?
A fling, you know?
Well, it's a simple crime of passion, isn't it?
Just 'cause her girlfriend likes a big rack.
Your impulsive losing of money at the stock markets.
Didn’t think when l bought it
Oh, total impulse. I hope it's not too much of an intrusion.
It can be dangerous listening to your impulses.
I had an urge to see the house.
We decided on the spur of the moment.
A fling! You know, we were young.
And on a dare, I hotwired a car, I got caught.
So on impulse, I put my hand on him.
Heat of the moment, maybe.
L came here on a stupid whim.
The occasional murderous impulse,
They don’t give you the death penalty for crimes of passion.
One - time impulse killers.
A crime of passion.
Something rash.
Crime of passion.
A crime of passion? It certainly looks like one.
That happiness born of passion is always short - lived.
Heat of the moment.
You felt a twinge, it was your heart and you're dead now.
He's not going to be back for a while.
That's enough for now. - yeah.
And they won’t see anything for a while.
It's probably gonna be a while.
There's not enough time for you to make it all the way -
This'll take a while.
This is going nowhere fast. We really should go, grandmother.
Don’t you write your old man off just yet.
It's not like they're gonna change anytime soon.
Well, I can’t explain now.
Comin 'back slowly, but surely.
It's gonna take a little more than a minute.
It won’t take a minute.
About all the things we should have done for this good man.
He won’t be back for a while. I'll tell him you called.
And I don’tintend to die anytime soon.
Lt won’t be anytime soon.
And he ain’tscoring anytime soon.
It's complicated, but I'm okay.
It doesn't look like it's letting up.
Got caught up in a moment.
It takes time.
Won’t be back for a while.
Will be gone most of the night.
Yeah, it's gonna be a while.
I won’t have proof positive for a couple hours, but.
I need time to find it.
For a bit.
Must be overwhelming.
It's a long story and I'd hate to have
Can't really socialize 'cause I'm running late.
Which is more than I can say for you.
Before there's anyone to see me who matters.
Things are going to be busier all around for a while.
Be patient.
It was thoughtless - fine.
And suddenly it's all woebegone maidens and dramatic deaths.
Little slips happen.
Temporary lapse in judgment.
I'm so careless, I almost missed you
I lost control for a minute.
Lucky shot, lucky shot.
Because of one mistake
Of his confederates.
I'm just stalling
I mean, it was just bad judgment.
No, no, not so fast.
Grew lonely.
Sometimes, you treat him nice. Other times, you hit and scold him to death.
In the far reaches of the quell system.
Quite a glorious pair for a while - very Nick and Nora.
You scared at all? No.
Lt's complicated, but we're gonna need a different house.
Forgot.
Heat of the moment. It'll never happen again.
It just slipped out. - it's okay.
Of course you were thrown off balance.
And been inspired to add some finishing touches.
Spur of the moment. Sorry I missed your birthday.
I slipped my mind.
An old habit... A friend kiss.
When it didn't happen right away, I - I wasn't too worried.
One minute, you're closer to someone than anyone in the whole world,
I lost control. Brilliant.
For panicking, for turning this into.
No, I don’t think so.
Well, I can’t think now.
Can't think of his name now. James Noakes.
The name escapes me now.
Don’t know off the top of my head, but I could check my time card.
I'm blanking... Who was it?
I lost my mind and wanted to commit suicide.
One day she's into safe. Next day she's into sexy.
In a moment of colossal stupidity, I panicked and told her I'm not ready for sex.
I panicked.
And was frightened
One or all time losers.
This has all just been too much.
I get bored.
It was in the heat of the moment,
To do without it entirely.
And I panicked.
Won’t leave here that soon
In a moment of weakness, and I feel better. Thank you.
Spur of the moment, seemed like the right thing.
So I've run out to ease the steam.
And with your blood boiling, you went to the professor's office,
I lost my temper and fought with him
Really, just heat of the moment.
When I first saw you at the club.
Slipped your mind?
Never have an ashtray in this town
She got loose somehow.
Having more man than wit about me, drew.
Having a moment.
I started out to prove something, and now it isn't important anymore.
Stupidly, yes. We received the leak.
Misdemeanor stupidity.
With a crime of passion, is it?
Driver's license in the one place of their last attack.
Slipped your mind? Oh, for - right.
A moment's ecstasy, a moment's excuse,
A fling.
In a momentary feeling toward her.
Acted on impulse,
A moment's distraction can change the duel's outcome.
For the time being, yeah.
Over our own hearts.
It was just a phase. It's over.
Temporary setback. I got it.
And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
One moment of deception.
Be cruel to be kind.
A momentary cessation of stupidity.
It isn't worth buying off
But in that moment of weakness, they lost everything.
Sometimes a little discomfort in the beginning
Be rash sometimes my neck is on the line!
Nobody springs to mind.
It's just an infatuation. It's nothing.
It's a lot to hear.
I can’t believe I'm hearing them.
Stupidity?
That she's lost her reason.
Well, I didn’t know.
When you did what you did.
Confused? I'd say so!
Everything that's been goin 'on.
It has its moments.
Heat of the moment. Whatever.
Only temporary?
In a moment of colossal stupidity,
It's like a red mist or.
It's... It's hard to explain.
For a moment I couldn't remember.
Lost his head.
Complicated.
You sometimes say here, sometimes there.
It just slipped out of my mouth.
To learn English!
One lapse in concentration, one wrong judgment,
You cannot be blamed for being weak.
I believed them and went to gamble.
I still can’t pay you now.
Good in the moment, not so much in the long, tedious haul.
It's hard to say at this point.
Uh, not off the top of my head.
It's too soon to tell.
It was a mistake. I'm little, you cheat big.
With a thousand thoughts at once.
Everything was going wrong at the same time.
Once his first compositions began to be played around
Is going anywhere anytime soon.
For a while - but only briefly -
This is a lot to process.
For a while, almost every building that went up
Laughing and crying all at the same time, and you never want it to end.
And yet such power, that for one single moment
Whilst at one moment the bold hills
Unlock everything at once? Fast and efficient?
Can't think of any right now, but,
I think I was
We didn't have any other leads. I thought, what harm could it do?
And for a moment, it was like being back there in the dark again, just the two of us.
It's hard to accept so many questions, but sometimes.
In a moment all the world can change
They were just spraying bullets everywhere.
Flowers were now driving a huge increase in the diversity of life.
One. Time's up.
I got caught up in the moment, it was a rash decision, but I changed my mind.

At one time, then, the town must have been full of tanneries.

A lot to take in.
Doesn't make much sense out of context.
I wasn't used to it at all.???
Elena: it's a lot, I know.
It's a little hard to explain, come on.
Creates quite a bond.
It felt right.
A brief fling... You're not alone in this.
We got carried away and had a few drinks
A momentary effusion of too much good cheer.
It's just infatuation, I suppose. I'm never there
